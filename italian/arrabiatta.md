"Arrabiatta" literally means angry in Italian. 

Traditionally the sauce just had garlic, tomatoes, and dried red chili peppers cooked in olive oil. The recipe below, however, has been modified to include basil, butter, and optionally dairy poducts.

Produce:
* 4 tomatoes
* 1 onion (chopped)
* 12-15 fresh basil leaves

Spices and oils:

* 2-3 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 tsp basil crushed powder
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper

Optional:
* 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Boil the tomatoes beforehand and peel them.
1. Heat butter and olive oil. You can modify the ratio of butter to olive oil as needed.
1. Add garlic cloves red pepper flakes on medium high heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
1. Add chopped onion and keep going on medium high for 5-6 minutes.
1. Add in the tomatoes, basil (both fresh and crushed), salt, and pepper. Cook on low heat and mash tomatoes until soft and like a sauce.
